# Michigan Terminal System

MTS is an operating system running on IBM System/360 compatible
mainframes dating from the late 1960s. It ran at a number of universities
in the US, UK and Canada until the late 90s, It provided batch and
interactive access with a large number of programs and tools included
in the standard distribution.

I have written about MTS in much more detail on my other site
[try-mts.com](https://try-mts.com/).

# COBOL

COBOL, the COmman Business Orientated Language, is an imperative
compiled language invented in 1959 and still in widespread use today
for commercial data processing.

Given its intended domain, this is not a great choice for implementing
TPK. There was also no standardised support for floating point and
mathematical functions like sqrt until the 1980s, so implementations
here may use fixed point/integer math and non-standard extensions.

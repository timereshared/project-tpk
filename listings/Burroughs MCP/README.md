# Burroughs MCP

Running on Burroughs B5500 machines from the mid 1960s, MCP (Master
Control Program) offered both batch and time-sharing programming
facilities, the latter using a shell called CANDE (Command and Edit).
Burroughs provided time-sharing versions of Algol 60, BASIC, Fortran
and COBOL. Contemporary users also implemented other languages, such
as WIPL (a JOSS clone) and APL.

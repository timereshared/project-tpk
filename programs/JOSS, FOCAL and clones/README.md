# JOSS, FOCAL and clones

JOSS, the Johnniac Open Shop System, was a pioneering time-sharing
system that provided a simple yet powerful langaueg to do calculations
and run small programs. Many computer manufacturers and computer
centres produced their own versions, usually under a different name
and with changes to syntax. One popular offshoot was DEC's FOCAL.
